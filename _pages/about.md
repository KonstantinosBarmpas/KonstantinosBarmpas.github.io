I'm a second year PhD student in Machine Learning / Brain-Computer Intergaces (BCIs) at the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), under the supervision of [Prof. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). My main research interests lie in the intersection of Deep Learning and Brain-Computer Interfaces (e.g., Differentialable Signal Processing, Geometric Deep Learning, Causality).  

Since 2021, I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cogitat](https://cogitat.io), where I have been developing novel deep learning methods for EEG-based Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs).

Prior to joining the Department of Computing as a PhD student, I completed my Master of Engineering (MEng - intergrated Bachelors) at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/). I undertook my Master's year at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://www.ethz.ch/de.html) as a visiting student where I had the honor to conduct my Master Thesis at the [Data Analytics Lab](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Hofmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.hofmann.html). 

My past working experience include in short: [Facesoft](http://facesoft.io) (Industrial placement - acquired by Huawei), [Daedalean AI](https://daedalean.ai) (Master Thesis project), [Smart Power Networks](https://smpnetworks.com) (Data Scientist) and [The Mouse Team](https://themouseteam.github.io) (Founder - Android Developer).

Before Imperial, during my gap year, I attended the bachelor's programme at [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/gr). As a high school student, I was a national champion and member of the Greek National Karate team.

Finally, I am currently an Academic Year Student Representative and Microsoft Student Ambassador for the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing).
