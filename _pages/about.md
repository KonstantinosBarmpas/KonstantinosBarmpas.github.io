I'm a final year PhD student in Machine Learning / Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) at the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), under the supervision of [Prof. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). My main research interests lie in the intersection of Deep Learning and Brain-Computer Interfaces (e.g., Differentiable Signal Processing, Geometric Deep Learning, Causality).  

Since 2021, I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cogitat](https://cogitat.io) where I have been developing novel deep learning methods for EEG-based Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Our work on decoding brainwave was featured by the [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/video/elon-musks-neuralink-company-implants-brain-chip-in-human-for-first-time-13060639), [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64720533), [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-played-a-video-game-by-thinking-the-mind-reader-revolution-is-real-ml59c86mx), [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/23/nhs-surgeon-challenging-musks-technology-connect-brain-internet/), [New Statesman](https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/big-tech/2024/01/mind-reading-elon-musk-neuralink), [Sifted](https://sifted.eu/articles/cogitat-grant-news/), and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-13-wearable-technology-and-remote-monitoring-startups-2022-9) among others. Check out our released [Demos](https://www.youtube.com/@cogitat1496).

During my PhD, I am also an Academic PhD Student Representative for the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), Main Organizer of Imperial Computing Conference ([ICC](http://icc.doc.ic.ac.uk/)), Co-Organizer of London Geometry and Machine Learning ([LOGML](https://www.logml.ai/)) Summer School, member of the Equity, Diversity and Culture Committee ([EDCC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/about/equality-and-diversity/edcc/)) for the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, a [Lakera AI Student Momentum Ambassador](https://www.lakera.ai/momentum) and a [Microsoft Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/profile/106866).

My past working experience includes in short: [Facesoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/facesoftltd/about/) (Machine Leaarning / Software Engineering Intern), [Daedalean AI](https://daedalean.ai) (Machine Learning Thesis Project), [Smart Power Networks](https://smpnetworks.com) (Data Scientist) and [The Mouse Team](https://themouseteam.github.io) (Founder - Android Developer).

Prior to joining the Department of Computing as a PhD student, I completed my Master of Engineering (MEng - intergrated Bachelors) at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/). I undertook my Master's year at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://www.ethz.ch/de.html) as a visiting student where I had the honor to conduct my Master Thesis at the [Data Analytics Lab](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Hofmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.hofmann.html). 

Before Imperial, during my gap year, I attended the bachelor's programme at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/gr) and the Engineering Preparation programme at [Oxford Royale Academy](https://www.oxford-royale.com) (University of Oxford - St. Catherine's College). As a high school student, I was a national champion and a member of the Greek National Karate team.
