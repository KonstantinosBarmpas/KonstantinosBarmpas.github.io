I'm a penultimate year PhD student in Machine Learning / Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) at the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), under the supervision of [Prof. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). My main research interests lie in the intersection of Deep Learning and Brain-Computer Interfaces (e.g., Differentiable Signal Processing, Geometric Deep Learning, Causality).  

Since 2021, I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cogitat](https://cogitat.io) - [check out our released [Demos](https://www.youtube.com/@cogitat1496)] - where I have been developing novel deep learning methods for EEG-based Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs).

During my PhD, I am also an Academic PhD Student Representative for the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), a [Microsoft Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/profile/106866), Co-Organizer of Imperial Computing Conference ([ICC](http://icc.doc.ic.ac.uk/)) and Co-Organizer of London Geometry and Machine Learning ([LOGML](https://www.logml.ai/)) Summer School.

My past working experience includes in short: [Facesoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/facesoftltd/about/) (Machine Leaarning / Software Engineering Intern), [Daedalean AI](https://daedalean.ai) (Machine Learning Thesis Project), [Smart Power Networks](https://smpnetworks.com) (Data Scientist) and [The Mouse Team](https://themouseteam.github.io) (Founder - Android Developer).

Prior to joining the Department of Computing as a PhD student, I completed my Master of Engineering (MEng - intergrated Bachelors) at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/). I undertook my Master's year at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://www.ethz.ch/de.html) as a visiting student where I had the honor to conduct my Master Thesis at the [Data Analytics Lab](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Hofmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.hofmann.html). 

Before Imperial, during my gap year, I attended the bachelor's programme at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/gr) and the Engineering Preparation programme at [Oxford Royale Academy](https://www.oxford-royale.com) (University of Oxford - St. Catherine's College). As a high school student, I was a national champion and a member of the Greek National Karate team.
